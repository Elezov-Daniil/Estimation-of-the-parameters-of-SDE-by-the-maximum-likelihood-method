Constant Maturity Interest Rates. Fit models to a sample of historical interest rates over the period Jan 1, 1962 to April 8, 2021 (14,801 daily observations). Plot the historical daily time series and three time discretization benchmarks:
  (a) Kessler method,
  (b) Shoji-Ozaki method, and
  (c) Euler method
using MLE approuch. The parameter estimates display in Table for each method. Calculate the AIC and select the best model.
